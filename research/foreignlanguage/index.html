                        After a brief examination of the network traffic used by the Yabla online learning tool, it
                        became apparent that it was incredibly easy to exploit the method by which Yabla loaded
                        transcripts on the frontend in order to automate the completion of their games. A proof of
                        concept chrome extension was written to take advantage of this exploit. Other online language
                        tools such as Duolingo were evaluated, but similar exploits were not found.

                        Recently, my Spanish teacher announced that the class would begin to receive upwards of three
                        Yabla listening activities per week. The class has also been subject to Duolingo quotas, where
                        we are graded on completing hundreds of lessons in a given semester. Deciding to take advantage
                        of some software development experience, I decided to examine if I could complete these
                        assignments without spending vast amounts of time listening to native Spanish speakers
                        repeatedly or typing for hours on end.

            <h2>Meet Duolingo</h2>
            <p>
                Duolingo is a much newer and much more advanced online foreign language tool. It is written in React
                and.
                It is quick at makes use of animations. Duolingo is a much more complicated application than Yabla.

                        Yabla uses a PHP backend and a loose policy of one html page per application view. A detailed
                        analysis of XHR traffic was not necessary as almost all data and code to run the game is
                        provided within the first load of the php page <code>player_cdn.php</code>. It would appear that
                        dynamic content is provided through global javascript variables populated in a script tag at the
                        top of the page by PHP. A quick search of the first lyric of the song revealed the transcript
                        information in the global javascript variable <code>CAPTIONS</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is worth noting that upon opening the development console, Duolingo advertises that they are
                        hiring software engineers.

                    <p>
                        It is apparent immediately that Duolingo utilizes a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture,
                        so I choose to focus analysis on only XHR requests.

                                    detailed manner; however, I didn’t find the information very interesting. It did
                                    contain sensitive-looking user ids. It seems to me that this could be done much more
                                    efficiently by posting a JSON blob.

                        Notice that the result appears to be graded before being sent to the server. It would appear
                        that Duolingo is processing the grading on the frontend before sending it to the backend for
                        logging. This opens the doors for a potential exploit. However, it raises the question of which

                        In order to answer these questions, I decided to examine the code. I downloaded the javascript
                        file that appeared to contain the application from
                        <code>http://d7mj4aqfscim2.cloudfront.net/proxy/js2/230720168c0b82eedd46-duolingo.js</code>.
                        Using free
                        online tools, I de-minified the code. The code appeared to be only partially obfuscated. As a
                        result, I was able to read all original function names. The code has some interesting features.
                        For instance, all instances of “true” have been replaced with “!0” and “!1” for “false.” This
                        was presumably done by a build engine to compress the file. The /log_graded_result endpoint is
                        called from the following function logGradedSolution():

                        These issues could be mitigated by creating a backend endpoint to validate question responses
                        and ensuring that the correct answer is not passed to the client. If the backend validates
                        responses, there is no way for the client to know what the correct response is until the user
                        figures it out.

                        Yabla uses a PHP backend and a loose policy of one html page per application view. A detailed
                        analysis of XHR traffic was not necessary as almost all data and code to run the game is
                        provided within the first load of the php page <code>player_cdn.php</code>. It would appear that
                        dynamic content is provided through global javascript variables populated in a script tag at the
                        top of the page by PHP. A quick search of the first lyric of the song revealed the transcript
                        information in the global javascript variable <code>CAPTIONS</code>.

                    <p>
                        As a result, the game can be exploited very easily into giving up the answers to a student or
                        automation tool. I created a proof of concept chrome extension that automatically plays the game
                        using content scripts in a chrome extension. First, the script acquires and parses the
                        transcript data by bypassing chrome's content script sandboxing by parsing the DOM content of
                        the <code>script</code> tag. Then, it uses DOM manipulation to complete the blank textboxes
                        automatically.

                        These issues could be mitigated by creating a backend endpoint to validate question responses
                        and ensuring that the correct answer is not passed to the client. If the backend validates
                        responses, there is no way for the client to know what the correct response is until the user
                        figures it out.
